# Yelp Review Analysis

## Project Background 
Nowadays, people can recommend a restaurant to others simply by writing a review on Yelp. They can write anything about a restaurant, including parking, location, services, environment and food. For foodies, they can use these reviews as a reference to decide if they want to try a restaurant or not. More importantly, for restaurant owners, they could use these reviews to evaluate the performance of their restaurants. They could identify their popular dishes, improve their services or change their layouts accordingly. 

## Project Overview
Therefore, we performed text analytics on yelp dataset to derive business insights from customersâ€™ restaurant reviews. We provide restaurant owners/ managers with a dashboard summary to inform them of the improvement areas. We hope these insights could help restaurants better serve their customers.
