# Yelp Review Analysis

Nowadays, people can recommend a restaurant to others simply by writing a review on Yelp. They can write anything about a restaurant, including parking, location, services, environment and food. For foodies, they can use these reviews as a reference to decide if they want to try a restaurant or not. More importantly, for restaurant owners, they could use these reviews to evaluate the performance of their restaurants. They could identify their popular dishes, improve their services or change their layouts accordingly.
